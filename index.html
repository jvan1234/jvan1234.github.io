        <br>
        <p class="normalRegular">
            Changelings, primarily in old folklore, were old fairies that replaced babies. These babies were often taken for three purposes: for malice, for servitude or for care.<br>
            The changeling then acts as the baby for the human family. The changeling had noticable flaws, which includes deformities, illness, or immobility <a href="https://www.irishpost.com/life-style/exploring-the-irish-mythology-changelings-170347">(Source: Irish Post)</a>
            <br>
            <br>
            Changelings are often stand-ins for mental disorders and disabilities, such as ASD, ADHD, BPD, and much more.
            While I only have been confirmed for having ASD, I feel that the changeling is representative of how socially seperated ASD can make the individual feel and the masks they must put on to fit in.
