    <p class="normalRegular">Hey, my name is Joshua (sometimes referred to as Wiz)! I have many interests, which includes games, arts, and programming. Right now, however, I'm studying to be a Cybersecurity Engineer, which means I'll be in charge of keeping data safe! Below you can see some questions you may have, answered to the best of my ability.</p>

        <dt class="normalRegular">What encouraged the alias "Wiz"?</dt>
        <dd class="normalRegular">
            Wiz comes from two words: "Wizard" and "Whizz." "Whizz" means someone that is fast and knowledgable in something, and "Wizard" is a fantastical job that entails using magic. "Wiz" is both an abbreviation of "Wizard" -- represneting the wizard appearnance of my character -- and "Whizz" -- which represnets my knowledge in different subjects!

        <dt class="normalRegular">Why do you Represent yourself as a Changeling online?</dt>
        <dd class="normalRegular">
            Changelings, primarily in old folklore, were old fairies that replaced babies. These babies were often taken for three purposes: for malice, for servitude or for care.<br>
            The changeling then acts as the baby for the human family. The changeling had noticable flaws, which includes deformities, illness, or immobility <a href="https://www.irishpost.com/life-style/exploring-the-irish-mythology-changelings-170347">(Source: Irish Post)</a>
            <br>
            <br>
            Changelings are often stand-ins for mental disorders and disabilities, such as ASD, ADHD, BPD, and much more.
            While I only have been confirmed for having ASD, I feel that the changeling is representative of how socially seperated ASD can make the individual feel and the masks they must put on to fit in.
            <br>
            <br>
            Overall, Changelings are just cool

        <dt class="normalRegular">Why did you pick Cybersecurity?</dt>
        <dd class="normalRegular">
            Cybersecurity came up later in my life. When I was around 13 or 14, I researched a hacking tool called "Google Dorking," which allowed me to look up sensitive information that companies may not want others to know about. Thankfully, the worst I did was look up security cameras and just check out what the surroundings looked like
            <br>
            <br>
            However, around 15 to 16, I discovered a website called <a href="https://www.hackthissite.org/">Hack This Site</a>, which allowed me to explore different exploits on webservers, with the legal safety of it being broken on purpose.
            <br>
            <br>
            In the ever growing age of AI and what's known as "Vibe Coding," my job will grow more important than ever. With AI's flawed vision of potential exploits, my eyes will be able to catch and fix these present mistakes that could leak delicate information to the world!
